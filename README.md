# Py Me Up, Charlie

## Background

This repository contains a multi-project task where I was asked to create **two** Python programs, PyBank and PyPoll. 

### Pre-Programming Prep

* First, I created this repository on GitHub and then cloned it to my computer.

* Inside my local git repository, I created a directory for both Python programs. 

* Inside both `PyBank` and `PyPoll` folders, I was tasked to add:

  * A new file called `main.py`. This would be the main script I would be running for each analysis.
  * A `Resources` folder that would hold the respective CSV files I would use in each program. 
  * An `analysis` folder that would hold a text file that has the results from my analysis.

* I then pushed the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.
